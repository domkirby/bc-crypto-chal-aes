Welcome to your crypto side quest. This is easy, if you can use Python.

I'll offer you a couple of tips:
- You'll need pycryptodome (``pip install pycryptodome``)
- On Windows, Python always works better in PowerShell
- You'll need to ensure you have the ``key`` and ``iv`` files in addition to the ``.py`` files in the same directory. If you have git, do a ``git clone https://github.com/domkirby/bc-crypto-chal-es.git`` to download the whole repo easily.

## Syntax
This is very simple to use.
``python3 ./encrypto.py "plaintext"`` for example.

## Note
If you aren't doing the Pax8 Security Bootcamp CTF, feel free to tinker. however, this is a terrible tool if you're looking to actually secure data. It's just for fun.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE AN ACTUAL DATA SECURITY TOOL**
